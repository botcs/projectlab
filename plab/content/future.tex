\section{Future}

\paragraph{Short-term plans.}
Continue training with different parameters
Try to evaluate samples by plotting them first

\paragraph{Long-term plans}
Utilize OneShot learning to tackle the small-train set problem.
Implement DANN training to transfer our best model's trained parameters to real world applications which may introduce different sample density.
