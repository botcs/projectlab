\chapter{Evaluation}

Evaluation of modells:

Separating the given set to -> train/eval/test

Because of unbalanced data -> extended precision recall -> Confusion Operator

Data augment -> trained on quasi-balanced totally augmented set

Data normalization -> BPM normalization through R wave detection with Pan Tompkins filtering -> invariant Time Features reveals

To make the network more sensitive on the rare samples of AF we introduced weighted loss training, where the mentioned samples yielded larger loss -> forcing the algorithm to categorize the undersampled classes more accurately.
